## Pythia AI Predictor🤑
Our approach on creating an AI that will predict the price of cryptocurrencies and stocks with a mathematically positive expectation.

This project had the status of a pet project as part of the team's AI competency development. As it developed and received mathematically positive expectations, the team decided to promote the status of the project and develop it into a standalone product.

Thus appeared Pythia, an oracle who knows the future one candle ahead. 

The current status of Pythia:
+ Markets: CRYPTO: BTC-USDT
+ Intervals: 15m, 30m, 1h

A very rough roadmap of the features development:

- [X] BTC binary predictor for the 15m interval
- [X] BTC binary predictor for the 30m interval
- [X] BTC binary predictor for the 1h interval
- [X] Development of API and trading bots integration
- [ ] Development AI based automated trading system
- [ ] Adding another markets\assets
